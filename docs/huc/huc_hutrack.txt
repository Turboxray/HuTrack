	HuC PC-Engine / TurboGrafx-16 development projects.

	HuTrack a tool suite that allows music to be created in the furnace tracker software, 
	and then exported data from Furnace can be converted to usable data by HuC for HuCard PSG driven audio.

Workflow Overview

	Export the song from Furnace as .dmf file
	Convert the .dmf file to a bundle of .inc files using hutrackconverter.bat
	Include the HuTrack.c library in yoru application
	Include the song into your application with #incasmlabel(alias name for asset, include path)
	Instantiate the HuTrack functions with HuTrack_Init();
	Queue up a song you want to play with HuTrackEngine_QueueSong(alias name of asset);
	Between vsyncs begin playing a song with HuTrackEngine_PlaySong(index value of song to play);
